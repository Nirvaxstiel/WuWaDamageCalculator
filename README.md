# This is a tool to help you visualise the Echo Set formations and compare them.
Visit the GitHub Page you can see on the `About` section on GitHub, or [here](https://nirvaxstiel.github.io/WuWaDamageCalculator/).

Sub-Stats/Other Bonuses are values that are outside of your echoes. Such as Weapons and Passives. Please subtract them accordingly.

Alternatively, you can help yourself by manually inputting the % values into these text boxes, instead of selecting slots.
